Key Features
============

Overview
--------

Mixer synchronizes in real time the modifications done to the scene and the objects it contains. During a collaboration session, Mixer displays the position of other participants and highlights their selections. 
See :ref:`work-together` for more details.

In the sections bellow we listed the features of Blender that are synchronized and those which are volontary not, as well as what is currently supported and what is not.

.. warning::
    **Undo / Redo is a important pitfall at the moment** for technical as well as paradigm reasons.
    It is strongly adviced **not to use it**, it may destabilize the running collaborative session.
    
    See :ref:`caveats` for more details.

.. _synchronized:

What is synchronized
--------------------

Most of the elements contained in a scene, the data types, are synchronized, as well as the custom properties of all datablocks.
The following table summarizes the covered features and a note indicates when synchronization is not available because the feature has not been implemented yet.

==============  ==================  ==============================================

.. [Armature]
    Issues remain with rigs generated by Rigify.

.. [Convert]
    The result of object conversion (**Object**/**Convert to** menu) is not synchronized.

.. _update-delays:

.. [Delay]
    Some updates may be delayed until another modification is detected:

    * scene annotations: try to click around in the background of the 3D viewport
    * animation curves names : try to toggle the curve *Enable* checkbox twice.

.. [Edit]
    While an object is not in Object mode (in Edit, Sculpt, Paint, ...) the local modifications to this object are
    not sent to the other participants and the other participants modifications are not applied. Pending modifications
    are applied when the mode changes.

.. [GreasePencil]
    * the mask layer is not correctly synchronized
    * area fill is sometimes not correct

.. [Image]
    Generated images and UDIMs are not synchronized. Image files are synchronized.

.. [Library]
    Nested libraries will fail when shared folders are not in use. The following are not synchronized:

    * the results of **make local** and **reload**
    * library overrides

.. [Media] 
    Media files are synchronized. The result of **reload** or media path modification are not synchronized.

.. [Nodes]
    Links synchronization sometimes fails. Some cases might cause crashes.


.. _not-synchronized:

What is NOT synchronized
------------------------

In order to provide to all participants a collaborative experience with as much freedom as they have during a solo session some features are deliberately not synchronized.
This is the case for most User Interface elements, user preferences and configuration.

Render engine          See [RenderEngine]_
=====================  =====================================================

.. [SceneCurrentCamera] Although belonging to the scene properties, preventing the current camera to be synchronized allows each user to view and render the scene from the camera of her choice

.. [RenderEngine] Each user can render either with Eevee, Cycle or another avaiable engine of her choice

.. _caveats:

Caveats
-------

In addition to the limitations listed in the previous section, you should be aware of the following limitations:

Undo / Redo
***********

Using undo may cause data desynchronisation between users, unexpected behaviors and possibly some crashes. Using undo while in **Object** mode may undo other participants changes.
**It is then strongly adviced not to use the undo feature during a collaborative session.**

The undo action rises several paradigm questions such as:

- What happens in the scene when an action is undone and some work dependent on it has been done by other users, such as a mesh edit, a constraint, etc?
- What should be undone? The last action of the user doing the step backward or the last action made by any user of the session? Or all the actions of everyone up to the last action of the considered user?
- Should a redo be possible?
- ...

Once the expected behavior clearly defined there is a technological challenge to face in order to address it.

Currently the undo and redo actions are "possible" as part of the default behavior of Blender.
For the reasons mentioned above doing one of them can very likely, according to the context, lead to an unstable environment.
It can be noticed from error messages in the terminal or more obviously from differences in terms of data in the shared scene.

**At this point a synchronisation recover is unlikely and it is adviced that one of the users save the scene on her computer, everyone leaves the room and a new session is started.**

In order to minimize the chances of doing an undo action we thought about blocking this feature during a session. We don't know if this is possible and have not gone further in that direction at the moment.

File saving
***********

The files saved by all participants are :ref:`not exactly identical <saves-not-identical>`.
